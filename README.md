## H7136 Sustainability in Engineering Lab App in MatLab

To Do list:
- Check CO2 calculations
- Estimate process timings more accurately

This program is a gamified simulatation of the results presented in the paper:

Sorgüven E, and Mustafa Ö. *"Energy utilization, carbon dioxide emission, and exergy loss in flavored yogurt production process."* Energy 40, no. 1 (2012): 214-225.

The method in the paper is simulated and presented with controls for varying multiple factors including:
- Energy grid composition
    - Gas/Solar/Wind/Coal/Nuclear
    - Season
- Industrial Machine statisics
    - CO2e
    - Purchase cost
    - Process rate
    - Electricity/gas consumption
- Transport
    - Vehicle type (EV / ICE)
    - Fuel type
    - Size
    - Distances between locations
- Process start timing
- Final product weight
